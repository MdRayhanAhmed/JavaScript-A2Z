Stop and wait until something is resolved. 
Async & await is just syntactic sugar on top of Promises 
and like promises it also provides a way to maintain asynchronous 
operation more synchronously. So in JavaScript asynchronous operations 
can be handled in various versionsâ€¦ 

ES5 -> Callback
ES6 -> Promise
ES7 -> async & await
