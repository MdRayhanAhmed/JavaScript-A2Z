Scope
------
Scope means variable access. Scope determines where variable are defined and where they can be accessed.

A scope can be defined in three ways –

Local Scope: Variables declared within a function are accessible only within that function’s scope.
 This encapsulation prevents conflicts and unintended modifications from other parts of the code.

Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope, accessible
 from anywhere within the program. However, relying too heavily on global variables can lead to code 
 that’s harder to maintain and debug.

Block Scope: Introduced with the ‘let’ and ‘const’ keywords, block scope confines variables to the
 nearest enclosing pair of curly braces ‘{}’. This enhances code predictability and reduces the risk
  of variable hoisting, a behavior associated with the var keyword.
