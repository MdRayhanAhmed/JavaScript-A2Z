Hoisting
------
In Javascript, you can call a function before it is defined and you won’t get an error
 ‘Uncaught ReferenceError’. The reason behind this is hoisting where the Javascript 
 interpreter always moves the variables and function declaration to the top of the current 
 scope (function scope or global scope) before the code execution
