------------------------
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-objects/problem
Task
Complete the function in the editor. It has two parameters: a and b. 
 It must return an object modeling a rectangle that has the following properties:

* length: This value is equal to a.
* width: This value is equal to b.
* perimeter: This value is equal to 2*(a+b)
* area: This value is equal to a*b
Note: The names of the object's properties must be spelled
 correctly to pass this

Sample Input 0
4
5

Sample Output 0
4
5
18
20
Explanation 0
Given a length of a =4 and a width of b= 5, the Rectangle object's perimeter is 
4+4+5+5 = 18 and its area is 4*5 = 20

Problem 13 - Day 4: Count Objects
----------------------
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-count-objects/problem

It has one parameter: an array, a, of objects. 
 Each object in the array has two integer properties denoted by x and y.
 The function must return a count of all such objects o in array a that
  satisfy o.x == o.y.

Sample Input 0
5
1 1
2 3
3 3
3 4
4 5

Sample Output 0
2

Explanation 0
There are n=5 objects in the objects array:
* object S0= {x:1,y=1}
* object S1= {x:2,y=3}
* object S2= {x:3,y=3}
* object S3= {x:3,y=4}
* object S4= {x:4,y=5}
Because we have two objects o that satisfy o.x == o.y (i.e., object S0 and object S2),
 we return 2 as our answer.
