Problem 10 - Try, Catch, and finally
----------------------
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-try-catch-and-finally/problem

Task
Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter, s. 
 You must perform the following actions:
 1. Try to reverse string s using the split, reverse, and join methods.
 2. If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's message
    on a new line. 
 3. Print  on a new line. If no exception was thrown, 
    then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, 
    this should be the original string.
    
Sample Input 0
"1234"

Sample Output 0
4321
Explanation 0
s= "1234" is a string type, so it can be reversed without throwing an exception.
 Thus, we print the reversed value, 4321, as our answer.

Sample Input 1
Number(1234)

Sample Output 1
s.split is not a function
1234

Explanation 1

 s= Number(1234) is not a string type, so it can't be reversed using string
  functions. When we try to reverse it anyway, it throws an exception. 
  We then catch the exception and print its message, which is s.split is not a function.
   Next, we finally print s which, because it wasn't able to be reversed,
    is Number(1234).
